Each category contains a list of object.\
The object contains emojis in different format which includes image, hex, dec and Icon.

#### Like the example below

```json
  {
    "face": [
        {
          "name":"face with tears of joy",
          "hex":"1F602",
          "dec":"128514",
          "icon":"ðŸ˜‚",
          "img":"data:image/png;base64,..."
        },
        "..."
    ],
    "emotion": [
        {
          "name":"kiss mark",
          "hex":"1F48B",
          "dec":"128139",
          "icon":"ðŸ’‹",
          "img":"data:image/png;base64,..."
        },
        "..."
    ],
    "..."
  }
```

### Usage

Since it's a json format,  it can literally be used in any programming language.\
I created this for use in a WYSIWYG Editor project in order to add icons.\
However, I believe this could also be helpful to others who may need it.

### Caution

Be careful while trying to output every emoji data in your browser.\
It could potentially cause your browser to run slower (or even your editor) due to the large file contents

## Have a nice programming day!
